# Group-Increments

* Change the **path** to organize the desired folder.
* Change the split factor at **file_name.split('-')** to change separator (ex: monito-01 -> monito.01)

Run python script:

* py groupincrements.py / python groupincrements.py /...

It will split the file name by title + increment, create a folder named like the file's title if it doesn't exist and move all the incremental files to that folder.

You can delete the files in the [Project] folder and copy-paste the contents of [Project - copy] to quickly re-test the script.
